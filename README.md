# Global Life Expectancy & Health Metrics Analysis

## **About the Project**
This project explores life expectancy trends, mortality rates, and health expenditures across various countries. Using **Power BI**, the analysis provides insights into how economic and healthcare factors influence life expectancy worldwide.  

The dataset used in this project is sourced from **Google Sheets**, offering a comprehensive look at multiple health and economic indicators.

---

## **Objectives**
- Analyze **global life expectancy trends** over time.  
- Examine the **relationship between health expenditures and mortality rates**.  
- Identify **economic and healthcare factors** affecting life expectancy.  
- Provide **interactive visualizations** for better understanding and exploration.

## **Dataset Used**
The dataset consists of key metrics related to **health, economy, and mortality**.  

📄 **[Life Expectancy Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTJ38xWbXCqHfm1m7ny-27nKHlrsZhPldkfRf2dWy-Nv2jJLcrYQMpGbhuBcr1dCkbsacrPs0SDojW4/pubhtml)**

- **Adult Mortality** – Probability of dying between ages 15 and 60 per 1,000 population.  
- **Infant Deaths** – Number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births.  
- **Alcohol** – Alcohol consumption per capita.  
- **Health Expenditure (%)** – Percentage of GDP spent on healthcare.  
- **Hepatitis B & Measles (%)** – Vaccination coverage rates.  
- **BMI** – Average body mass index.  
- **Under-Five Deaths** – Mortality rate of children under five.  
- **Polio & Diphtheria (%)** – Vaccination rates.  
- **HIV/AIDS (%)** – HIV/AIDS prevalence rate.  
- **GDP** – Gross domestic product per capita.  
- **Population** – Total country population.  
- **Income Composition** – Income index measuring access to essential resources.  
- **Schooling** – Average years of schooling per person.

## **Key Questions Addressed**
- How do **life expectancy trends** differ across countries?  
- Does **higher health expenditure** correlate with **lower mortality rates**?  
- What role do **vaccination rates and economic factors** play in longevity?  
- Which countries experience **the highest child and adult mortality rates**?  
- How do **GDP, education, and healthcare spending** influence life expectancy?

## **Data Processing**
### **Data Cleaning**
- **Filled missing values** with appropriate estimates to avoid gaps.  
- **Converted categorical values** (e.g., "Developed" vs. "Developing") for analysis.  
- **Normalized numerical data** for trend comparisons.  

### **Data Transformation**
- Merged economic and healthcare data for comprehensive insights.  
- Created **calculated columns** such as:
  - **Health Expenditure per Capita**
  - **Mortality Rate per 1,000 Population**
  - **Life Expectancy Growth Rate**
  - **Vaccination Impact Score**  

- Applied **grouping and sorting** for better visualization clarity.
