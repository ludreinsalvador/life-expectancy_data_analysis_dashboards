# Global Life Expectancy & Health Metrics Analysis

## About the Project
This project explores life expectancy trends, mortality rates, and health expenditures across various countries. Using **Power BI**, the analysis provides insights into how economic and healthcare factors influence life expectancy worldwide.  

The dataset used in this project is sourced from **Google Sheets**, offering a comprehensive look at multiple health and economic indicators.

## **Objectives**
- Analyze global life expectancy trends over time.  
- Examine the relationship between health expenditures and mortality rates.  
- Identify economic and healthcare factors affecting life expectancy and global diphtheria cases.  
- Provide interactive visualizations for better understanding and exploration.

## **Questions**
- How do life expectancy trends differ across countries?  
- Does higher health expenditure correlate with lower mortality rates?  
- What role do economic factors play in longevity?  
- Which countries experience the highest child and adult mortality rates?  
- How do GDP, education, and healthcare spending influence life expectancy?

## **Data Processing**
### **Data Cleaning**
- **Filled missing values** with appropriate estimates to avoid gaps.  
- **Converted categorical values** (e.g., "Developed" vs. "Developing") for analysis.  
- **Normalized numerical data** for trend comparisons.  

### **Data Transformation**
- Merged economic and healthcare data for comprehensive insights.  
- Created **calculated columns** such as:
  - Combined expenditure
  - Under-Five mortality rate
  - Diphtheria cases per year
  - Diphtheria cases to adult mortality ratio

- Created **calculated measures** such as:
- Average life expectancy
- Sum expenditure
- Average diphtheria cases
- Total diphtheria cases
- Total no. of countries with diphtheria
