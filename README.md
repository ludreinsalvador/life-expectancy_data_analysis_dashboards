# **Global Life Expectancy & Health Metrics Analysis**

## **About the Project**
This project explores **life expectancy trends, mortality rates, and health expenditures** across various countries. Using **Power BI**, the analysis provides insights into how **economic and healthcare factors** influence life expectancy worldwide.  

The dataset is sourced from **Google Sheets**, offering a comprehensive look at **multiple health and economic indicators**.  

---

## **Objectives**
- Analyze global life expectancy trends over time.  
- Examine the relationship between health expenditures and mortality rates.  
- Identify economic and healthcare factors affecting life expectancy and global diphtheria cases.  
- Provide interactive visualizations for better understanding and exploration.

## **Questions**
- How do life expectancy trends differ across countries?  
- Does higher health expenditure correlate with lower mortality rates?  
- What role do economic factors play in longevity?  
- Which countries experience the highest child and adult mortality rates?  
- How do GDP and healthcare spending influence life expectancy?

## **Visualizations**
### **Proposed Power BI Charts**
üìå **Trend Analysis:**  
- Line charts for **life expectancy over time**.  
- Heat maps for **mortality distribution by region**.  

üìå **Comparative Insights:**  
- Bar charts comparing developed vs. developing countries.
- Geographic maps for health and economic disparities.

## **Data Processing**
### **Data Cleaning**
- Filled missing values with appropriate estimates to avoid gaps.  
- Converted categorical values (e.g., "Developed" vs. "Developing") for analysis.  
- Normalized numerical data for trend comparisons.  

### **Data Transformation**
- Merged economic and healthcare data for comprehensive insights.  
- Created **calculated columns**, such as:  
  - Combined Health Expenditure 
  - Under-Five Mortality Rate 
  - Diphtheria Cases per Year  
  - Diphtheria Cases to Adult Mortality Ratio  

- Created **calculated measures**, such as:  
  - Average Life Expectancy  
  - Total Health Expenditure  
  - Average Diphtheria Cases 
  - Total Diphtheria Cases
  - Total Number of Countries with Diphtheria
